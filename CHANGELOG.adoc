===  Breaking changes

* v2: encode/decode WebSocket request/response body using base64

Due to dynamic value of WebSocket request/response body and
since the request/response will be transferred using JSON format,
it would be safe and faster if the body itself is not encoded with JSON.

For example, previously to send parameter pair as JSON object it would
result in escaped JSON syntax,

  {
      "id": 1587701148,
      "method": "GET",
      "target": "/v2/user/trades/open",
      "body": "{\"pair\":\"ten_btc\"}"
  }

The new request using base64 would be like,

  {
      "id": 1587701148,
      "method": "GET",
      "target": "/v2/user/trades/open",
      "body": "eyJwYWlyIjoidGVuX2J0YyJ9"
  }

===  Enhancements

*  v2: allow empty pair on private WebSocket UserTradesOpen

If pair is empty it will return all open trades in all pairs.


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.4 (2020.06.05)

===  Bug fixes

*  v1: set parameter asset name on trade

If trade method is sell the asset name is coin name, otherwise the asset
name is base name.

*  v2: set default trade method to "limit"


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.3 (2020.05.20)

===  Bug fixes

*  all: set TLSConfig only if IsInsecure is set

When connecting to HTTP only address, for example when testing, setting
Environment.IsInsecure to true make the connection timeout due to
connection is still using TLS.

This changes fix this issue by initializing TLSConfig only if
Environment.IsInsecure is set.

v2: remove pair checks, let the server do the check

Due to changes on pairs on the server, client may still use the old
module that contains delisted pairs or not contains new pairs.
This may cause an unexpected errors on the client side.

To minimize this error, we remove the check on pairs and let the server
do them.

either open or closed.
