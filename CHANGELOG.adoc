= CHANGELOG

==  tokenomy-go v0.8.0 (2020.07.xx)

===  Breaking changes

Change the API paths from `trades` into `orders`,

* `/v2/user/trades/closed` become `/v2/user/orders/closed`
* `/v2/user/trade` become `/v2/user/order`
* `/v2/user/trades/open` become `/v2/user/orders/open`
* Return the coin, base, and price as string with eight digit precision


===  Enhancements

* trade: remove unused field Fee


==  tokenomy-go v0.7.0 (2020.06.18)

This release add new asset name "lyfebep" and pairs "lyfebep_ikd", "idk_usdt".

===  Breaking changes

*  all: call log.Fatal if there is an error when generating signature.
   The Sign() function is essential process that must be success.
   Returning an empty string if there is an error from this function
   may result in undetected error in client side.

*  v2: rename PrivateWebSocket to WebSocketPrivate

*  all: replace TradePrice with Trade.
   Basically, TradePrice type and its contents is Trade with less fields.
   We can use the Trade type and fill only the required fields and it will
   convert to JSON with the same output.

===  New features

*  v1: use the tokenomy.Sign function to generate signature

*  v2: add parameter "offset" and "limit" to MarketTrades on REST Client

*  v2: implement client for public WebSocket.
   The public WebSocket contains three APIs that are similar with the
   REST APIs,
** MarketDepths: list of market's depths for specific pair
** MarketTicker: list of ticker information on specific pair
** MarketTrades: list of all completed trades in the market, specific to pair,
   grouped by ask and bid

*  v2: add API to withdraw user's asset

===  Enhancements

*  all: call log.Fatal if there is an error when generating signature

*  v2: add parameter "offset" and "limit" to MarketTrades on REST Client

===  Bug fixes

*  v2: fix wrong API path on MarketDepths

*  Fixes some empty responses due to variables are not passed as pointer to
   v2.Response.Data.

*  v2: check for nil on amount and price


==  tokenomy-go v0.6.0 (2020.06.05)

===  Breaking changes

*  all: rename TradeOpens to TradesOpen
*  all: move MarketTradePrices to base package

While at it, add field Pair to trade prices so client can know the
pair where trade belong to.


==  tokenomy-go v0.5.0 (2020.06.05)

===  Breaking changes

* v2: encode/decode WebSocket request/response body using base64

Due to dynamic value of WebSocket request/response body and
since the request/response will be transferred using JSON format,
it would be safe and faster if the body itself is not encoded with JSON.

For example, previously to send parameter pair as JSON object it would
result in escaped JSON syntax,

  {
      "id": 1587701148,
      "method": "GET",
      "target": "/v2/user/trades/open",
      "body": "{\"pair\":\"ten_btc\"}"
  }

The new request using base64 would be like,

  {
      "id": 1587701148,
      "method": "GET",
      "target": "/v2/user/trades/open",
      "body": "eyJwYWlyIjoidGVuX2J0YyJ9"
  }

===  Enhancements

*  v2: allow empty pair on private WebSocket UserTradesOpen

If pair is empty it will return all open trades in all pairs.


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.4 (2020.06.05)

===  Bug fixes

*  v1: set parameter asset name on trade

If trade method is sell the asset name is coin name, otherwise the asset
name is base name.

*  v2: set default trade method to "limit"


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.3 (2020.05.20)

===  Bug fixes

*  all: set TLSConfig only if IsInsecure is set

When connecting to HTTP only address, for example when testing, setting
Environment.IsInsecure to true make the connection timeout due to
connection is still using TLS.

This changes fix this issue by initializing TLSConfig only if
Environment.IsInsecure is set.


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.2 (2020.05.18)

===  Enhancements

*  UserNotifications: new type to represent user's notification preferences

The user notification preferences will be returned when calling
"/v2/user/info".


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.1 (2020.05.12)

===  Enhancements

*  environment: remove setting log flags to 0
*  v2: use the same default address for private WebSocket
*  Add constants for list of valid trade's status


==  tokenomy-go v0.4.0 (2020.05.05)

==  tokenomy-go v0.3.0

v2: implement private WebSocket client

The private WebSocket client can handle trade, trade cancellation,
and listing open trades.


==  tokenomy-go v0.2.1

v2: remove pair checks, let the server do the check

Due to changes on pairs on the server, client may still use the old
module that contains delisted pairs or not contains new pairs.
This may cause an unexpected errors on the client side.

To minimize this error, we remove the check on pairs and let the server
do them.


==  tokenomy-go v0.2.0

This release refactoring the struct Order and Trade in v2 to make it
consistent.
In v1, we use the term "order" and "trade" to convey the same information.
In v2, we use the term "trade" for all information related to trading,
either open or closed.

===  Breaking changes

*  Change the market trades open API from "/v2/market/orders/open" to
   "/v2/market/trades/open"

*  Change the user's trades open API from "/v2/user/orders/open" to
   "/v2/user/trades/open"

*  Change the user's trades closed API from "/v2/user/orders/closed" to
